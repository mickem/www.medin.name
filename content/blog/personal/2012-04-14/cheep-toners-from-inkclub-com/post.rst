Is the cheep toner from InkClub really the same as the
slightly more expensive toner from HP?

After testing I can say that it is not the same and the slightly cheaper
toner from InkClub is horrendous and not worth the price at all…

Syringe filling ink cartridges
==============================

Waaay back in the early 1990:s I was using a very nice Canon Color Ink
printer. I loved the little thing but alas ink was very expensive so
what I used to do was buy my own ink and use a syringe to fill the
cartridges up a few times before exchanging them. Now fast forward to
2012 and here I am with a nice not-so-little (read huge) monster of a HP
Laser Jet color printer. And alas the toners are expensive. So I thought
to my self wonder if there is a difference between them cheep toner that
InkClub sells or if it is just a matter of price?

Discovering the difference…
===========================

|crap-toner|\ Well, A while back I was going to replace all toners in my
printer and though hey: lets give it a shot and picked a cheep toner as
a replacement for the black color. I have used it for the odd month or
so and have though “well seems to work ok” and forgotten about it. But
alas yesterday I was going to print a photo and lo and behold it looked
horrific. So I though damn it printer is broken! And spent some time
trying cleaning, calibration and what not without any improvement.

So I went to the local store and purchased an official HP toner and
printed the same exact photo and the improvement was astounding.

The problem
===========

It seems to me that the problem is that the toner cant deliver enough
color. If I look at the edge of the photo the first few centimeters
contain a nice dark blackness but then it goes away and ends up as
grayish patterns. And I think this is why t “worked ok” because when you
print text you don’t need as much color so the toner can deliver enough
to work.

Another interesting fact is that the cheep toner leaks oil and has a lot
of taped on parts and generally gives of a cheaper feel. It is also
scratched and looks much older then the HP tooner. And yes the InkClub
toner is “older” but if I compare the even older color toners I also
have in the printer they are spot on exactly like the brand new HP toner
so I doubt age is the issue.

    **Hence forth I will stick to HP toners!**
