Since I am pretty new to this blogging thingy I will try to write what
you can expect form this blog. I have in fact started to blog many times
before but never lasted 5 posts so where as this is not new it is new in
the sense that I intend to actually give it some effort this time.

.. PELICAN_END_SUMMARY

The main topics will be:

-  Monitoring
   Nagios, Icinga, NSClient++
-  Development
   SOA, C++, Java, Python, …
-  Personal
   Myself, My family, …

The reason for having many topics (or categories as they seem to be
called in the blogging world) is that I felt having **three blogs would
mainly be to much** work but also seems rather silly as there will be
four posts per year that way. So instead I will combine it all here.

=======================

Since I am the author of NSClient++ I have for some time been wanting to
blog about monitoring mainly as I feel there is **far to little blogs**
on the subject (that I have found) but mainly as I feel I have things to
write about and **non place to write it** as the “blog” on
`nsclient.org <http://nsclient.org>`__ is not really a blog.

|image|\ **Development**
========================

Primarily I am and always will be a developer. I spend **thousands of
hours** writing code and sometime I do things where I think now this
would be nice to share but as I have no place to share I end up just
ditching and forgetting it which means next time I need it I will have
to **figure it out all over again**. I am mainly involved in **SOA**
development at work which means technologies such as **Java, XML, Web
services**, Databases as well as Weblogic Server and what not. But a lot
of tooling is built in other languages such as **Python**, Perl,
**Excel** etc etc. In my personal space I dabble mainly in **C/C++** and
things revolving around that.

**Personal**
============

Well, I don’t really like Facebook so this will be my personal “I am
making coffee”, “I am drinking coffee”, “I need to pee” section.
Hopefully someone in my family will find it useful, if not maybe I will
stop? Regardless these posts might be in Swedish so I would recommend
not reading them unless you understand Swedish. Mainly my personal life
includes my Girlfriend, Lovely daughter and the “bonus child” which my
lovely girl friend brought along.

 

Well, this is pretty much it for now I guess…
