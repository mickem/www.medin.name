Sometimes I am actually not working with my computer. Usually this
happens during summer when I am having what other people call vacation.
This year I spent parts of the summer helping my mother fix up her
house.

.. PELICAN_END_SUMMARY

The Old Kitchen
===============

|DSC03632|\ Mothers house is actually my Grandmothers old summer-house
which she inherited when my grand mother passed away two years ago. At
the time the place was a bit run down as no one had taken care of it for
the last few years so there is plenty of work to be done. This time my
main focus was the smaller of the two buildings (where I and my family
usually live when we visit).

I started fixing it last year when I helped exchange the roof and
installed two new windows as well as turn the hallway into a makeshift
kitchen.

This year the idea was to fix the floor as well as insulate the last
un-insulated wall. The project started off with a bit of a bummer when I
removed the carpets and various other things they had placed on the
floor only to discover that the floor was in fact not (like the rest of
the building) made of wood but concrete. So the original plan which was
to remove the old floor, dig out and adding new boards as well as top it
off with wooden laminate flooring did not pan out to well.

So after a quick discussion with mother we revised our strategy to add
leveling compound and on top of that a sheet of thick particle board to
make it level with the rest of the rooms and finally add the usual
wooden laminate flooring.

|DSC03675|\ Being in the spirit of building stuff I also tried to build
some strange sort of cabinet thingy to hang some clothes in not really
sure I liked the outcome of it though. The reason it looks like it is
leaning all over the place is that the walls are not straight (the house
is more than a hundred years old) so the cabinet (being straight) looks
a bit misplaced. But I figured it was a better option to having things
fall off had I chosen to go with having the walls as base.

Sleeping room
=============

|Cgosms_2012-06-2911-08-52|\ Now since I had all them planks we got for
the kitchen lying around I figured why not use them in one of the
sleeping rooms instead?

So the project expanded to cover on of the sleeping rooms as well. This
was a bit more challenging (and fun) as two of the beams had rooted away
(well, one rotted and one attacked by termites). Since the rotted beam
was carrying the wall I only reinforced it and tried to lift it back by
applying pressure. The other beam I replaced altogether using two brand
new beams. Notice the new square beams in contrast to the original
real-wood beams used 100 years ago.

|DSC03672|\ As always we added in a wooden laminate floor as well as new
moldings. The result was rather spectacular as the floor was almost
completely level now. Comparing to before when the broken beam caused
the floor to have an almost 10cm drop in the center. This is especially
nice since we have a slide-in bed which was rather difficult to slide on
the old floor.

Insulating the wall
===================

Next up was the “last old wall” to which I added some windows last year.
I started last year trying to attach some beams to the old wall in an
attempt to just add a new layer of insulation on top of the old wall.
This proved more difficult than I had anticipated (mainly due to the
earlier wall-builders using very thin beams making it all but impossible
to find and attach anything to them). This year we had decided to
replace the old wall all together. So I tor down all the old layers down
to the original plank wall and built a two new layers of beams adding
20cm of insulation as well as new boards. The entire things was
remarkably simple and quick much quicker then trying to path the old
wall.

New steps
=========

|trapp|\ The last (ish) major project was building new stairs for the
tiny building. The earlier stairs which was actually built by me as well
was well over 10 years old built out of non pressure-treated wood so
they had all but rotted away making it rather hazardous to enter the
building.

This project I approached with meticulous planning by first building a
3d-model using `Google Sketchup <http://sketchup.google.com/>`__.
Unfortunately due to some rather silly simplifications to the 3d-model
the entire thing turned out a bit more difficult than anticipated. In my
model I had not cared about the actual width of the boards instead I
just built the wire frame by connecting the various corners. This means
that the various boards in the mode was non the same width. So once I
had built the front part I noticed that the last few pieces did not fit
at all.

|20120719_171700|\ Fortunately my mother persisted saying it **was
possible** so after some paper modeling using a protractor and some
rulers I found some modifications which turned out as a rather nice
compromise. There were a few other mistakes as well such as
the height was 2cm to high and what not but I guess that was mainly a
miss match between the idea and the reality and not so much a problem
with the result. Regardless of any issues the end result turned out
rather nice. So it is now safe again to enter the building (for another
10 years or so).
