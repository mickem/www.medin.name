When I was a child I received an amazing Lego Technics set [http://brickset.com/sets/8860-1]("8860"). It instantly became my favourite toy above all others.
But in the instructions booklet there was another... bigger... cooler... more awesome... which became the dream...

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

![the dream]({static|DSC00798.JPG|thumb="200x_"}) But it was a combination model (or so I always thought) and getting my parents to buy me several sets was not going to happen so a dream it remained. But it has always remained a dream.
So when I saw [http://shop.lego.com/en-SE/Mobile-Crane-MK-II-42009]("42009") it was not without a hint of childhood dreams rushing back at me. Now this is a massive set and it is pretty expensive so I cannot really just buy it (my girlfriend would kill me).

So instead i gave some hints and managed to score on for my birth day :)
Well... actually I got half, in a stroke of genius she gave ma "half" opting for giving me the other half for Xmas, but alas I gave my self the other half instead :)

So what's it like to build a massive 2.600+ pieces Lego set?
I would compare it to laying a puzzle in other words a pretty calming, rather long experience. So I quite enjoyed it, but the comparison to a puzzle is good in other ways as well, the build of the Lego set was some 8 hours a 1.000 pieces puzzle will last you a lot longer.
A 1000 pieces puzzle will also cost you a whole lot less then 1.500SEK of the Lego set.
But to be honest this was waaaay more fun...

# 42009: An epic model

![an epic mode]({static|DSC00754.JPG})
This took me about "a day" some of it spent having my kids build it some of it spend rebuilding what my kids built and some of it spent rebuild when I tried to fix the skidding linear actuators.
It is a rather epic model. The size is daunting it is huge: I mean really huge. But it is not without flaws. The gear box is without par and really really amazing, I fondly remember the [http://brickset.com/sets/8860-1]("8860") which had a functioning gearbox where you could change between 3 gears. This has a gearbox controls 6 different functions in different pars with of the crane, all from a single motor: it is truly epic.

![it is huge]({static|DSC00754.JPG})
It has some issues though the biggest one is the use of linear actuators: I don't mind them from a technical perspective but instead the lack of a friction gear. When you run the crane down or up the edge position a heart tearing screech is heard when the linear actuators starts to skid. I would have prefered a friction gear instead.
It is also a shame the placed the steering wheel behind. Quite frankly I cant understand it, it might make it simpler to drive the model but it makes it far less real. Lastly the lack of motorized forwards propulsion seems a bit of a let down and I understand that you cant do everything but it would have pretty cool if they at least had an engine option for the mode to make it fully motorized.


# 42009-B: A not so epic model

![sort legos]({static|DSC00808.JPG})
Heading for the B-side I spent a good solid 2 hours tearing the model up. It was quite a job and almost gave me blisters.
A good thing I had Sophia helping me with sorting the Legos. This time I opted for not sorting studs by colour as it was a rather retarded way to sort them.
Instead I sorted studs by length and a lot of the pieces by size and then colour.
All in all the B set was pretty cool and looked like it could have been an A-set to be honest. 
I really enjoyed the build. And like the look of the models as well. 

![the b set]({static|DSC00873.JPG})
But again the big let down is the linear actuators and lack of friction gear and in this case they really ruin the model.
The apparatus which grabs the container is designed using linear actuators and once the reach the end position they crunching sets in. 
But the other thing which also sets in is a distinctive "jumping" as the linear actuator jump a bit when they skid at the end.
In this case this means the it model grabs the container and skids a bit and then jumps back releasing the container in essence making it impossible to actually grab the container. 
The words Epic fail comes to mind...

# Lego Technics: now and then

![joining lego in the 80:s]({static|joining-lego-DSC00881.JPG})
It was really interesting to revisit Lego Technics as an adult mainly just to see the development.
When I was a kid Lego Technics had a number of patters for building models and they repeated over and over. One was the way you locked pieces together. It is no more! There were a lot of others as well which seem to be all long gone instead a whole range of new Technics has replaced them. ANd I thought about that a lot during the build how "back in the days this would have been ... instead". In all honest I have to say the Lego Technics of the 2010:s are much better then the Lego Technics of the 1980:s.

# A dream come true?

![gear box]({static|DSC00802.JPG})
Indeed it is, and it was well worth it. The gear box was amazingly cool and well worth it.
: I cant help but dream of my next epic Lego model... question is: Will it be [http://shop.lego.com/en-SE/The-SHIELD-Helicarrier-76042](The-SHIELD-Helicarrier) or a Technics set?
