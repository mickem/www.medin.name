I have been quite for a few weeks, and that is not just because I have
been lazy. No in fact I have been extremely busy and will probably be
for the foreseeable future. But I shall try to squeeze out some time to
write the odd blog post in the new few weeks at least. So why have I
been busy you ask?

.. PELICAN_END_SUMMARY

Sophia
======

| Well, the reason is as the topic mentioned a bit of a
  family change as my second daughter was born on May 21 so excuse me if
  the reminder of this blog post is filled with sentimental gibberish
  |Ler|
|  It was an interesting view if the Swedish health-care system. Since
  my girls friend apparently like nights she went into labor around
  eight:ish or so and just before midnight we figured maybe it is time
  to head over to the hospital. Arriving at the labor ward we discovered
  it was full. Meaning we had to wait for about an hour before we could
  get a room assigned. Fortunately we were not in a real rush so sitting
  around in the waiting room was not  much worse than sitting waiting in
  the room… for me that is. My girlfriend was less than thrilled about
  it. So an hour or so later we were allowed into our room and maybe 2
  hours later after a rather event less birth my daughter was delivered
  in what they tell me was perfect health. I am an engineer so to me two
  hands, two feet, one head and some screams translates into healthy
  hence I would agree.

Now here comes the next interesting tidbit about health-care systems. I
could sort of feel that everyone was stalling everything was “if you
just wait a bit…”.

And after having spent an agonizing night/morning trying to sleep in the
rather uncomfortable thing called a couch I went out and asked them out
right: “How much longer till we get to the postpartum ward and the
response was it is currently full we are working on finding a place for
you.

Waiting…
========

|DSC03356|\ Now the irony here is that “our room” at the delivery ward
has to be by far more “expensive” in terms of usability as the
postpartum is just a room. The one we are in has all this fancy
giving-birth-equipment. So my guess is there was someone sitting outside
just like we did the night before waiting for the room we were waiting
to leave. Wouldn’t it make sense to have a few extra rooms in the
postpartum so they can in a pinch quickly get more room in the labor
ward? Obviously not or they would have done it right?

Now to cut in a bit of a tech angle here I have to say they had the most
bizar keyboard in the room. It was a rather normal easy-to-clean flat
thing without any bumps. But for some bizar reason they had printed a
3-d aspect on the buttons to make them look like regular non flat
keyboard…

|DSC03400|\ Anyways, after maybe 8-10 hours we got to transfer over to
the postpartum where we spent the day and the night following. Then, as
you might have expected, they sent us packing as they were…full… and
needed the room…

And here comes the third chapter.

Home too soon…
==============

|DSC03377|\ So happily we went home and I proudly dressed both my little
girls in new fancy clothing's from
`Janie&Jack <http://www.janieandjack.com>`__ (wicked nice baby clothes
BTW). The weather was nice and everyone was happy… Sorry about the hair
BTW now afterwards I feel a bit embarrassed all photos of me from the
hospital looks like this |Ler|

Anyways next day we had a scheduled checkout so I brought out the other
set of clothes I had bought from
`Janie&Jack <http://www.janieandjack.com>`__ and off we went. Here they
discovered her readings are “not good” but we were allowed home again
and set to return on Friday. Later I heard from the other doctor at the
neonatal ward that her values were actually so bad she wondered why we
were allowed to leave (yes, they were full again).

So again we are sent home and comes back on a new checkup on Friday when
they discover that the values are very very very “not good” (read
shitty)… And they sign us into the neonatal ward for first “observation”
which urns into UV sun treatment and force feeding through a gavage.

And here is when life turns really shitty.
==========================================

|DSC03402|\ Now with the benefit of hindsight I know this is “not really
critical” (apart from the fact that it took too long for her to get
treatment as her blood sugar levels values were far below 2 which
apparently is around where you turn comatose) but the UV treatment is
common enough especially in the Nordic area and the low blood sugar is
directly related as the bilirubin (which causes the Jaundice) makes them
to tired to eat.

So perhaps I should not have worried too much but I have to say it
really really feels horrible to spend the weekend in the hospital with
your little girl connected to tubes and what not… Hopefully not
something I will ever have to experience again.

Happily ever after
==================

|DSC03433|\ Now she is back to normal and everything is great again and
life feels much better but having two little ones my computer time is
quickly growing less and less.

Fortunately enough they both go to bed early so I still have some time
at nights to spend playing |Ler|.

Her name is Sophia (or Sofia we haven't signed the papers yet so
spelling is not finalized) though we tend to call her mei-mei
(妹妹) which is Chinese for “little sister”.

And as I said now she is doing great according to the doctors and again
me being the engineer as long as she is in between the “normal-lines” on
the chart I am inclined to agree! And hopefully, god willing, she will
stay that way till long after I am gone!
