This years birthday cake was a Hello Kitty inspired cake (not licensed
by Sanrio). It turned our rather nice and I though it was time
to summarize the cakes we have done thus far through out the years.
The whole cake obsession started for Evelinas first birthday where we
did a three story strawberry cake.

| I have always enjoyed doing something a bit special and since I am an
  engineer at heart I decided to start with something which was pure
  engineering. Hence it became the three story strawberry cake. Making
  them is pretty simple in essence you create three round cakes of
  varying size and stack them on-top of each other and place a bunch of
  wiped cream mixed with strawberries.
|  We did go a bit overboard with the candles but in all honesty I think
  pretty much everything about this cake was about excess. But it was
  the first ever cake we did so we wanted to make it special!

This year we spent at my mothers house so time and resources was
limited. So we ended up doing a pretty standard cake but still trying to
achieve the two story effect albeit a bit sloppy. The cake was lovely as
we used fresh strawberries though. And eating outside in the sun always
tastes better.

Now we were back home and it was time to step up the
came a bit. I insisted on a multiple story cake as always (it was
becoming a bit of an obsession). But to spice things up we went for
cheesecake instead of the regular whipped cream cakes. The challenge
with cheesecake is that there is no solid base to build on. Thus we
opted for two stories and not three. The lack of flair we made up for by
attempting some fancy home made chocolate walls and letters and what
not.

I personally think this is one the most splendid cakes we have done as
it almost looks professional to my amateur eyes but then: What do I know
about cakes?

The Sofia edition was raspberries and very tasty where as the other was
Mango which was, lets just say, not very tasty.

This is probably the biggest gamble ever and without some help from my
sister I think we would never have pulled it off. The design was for me
"unique" but Google proved that was not the case and I have since seen a
lot of stores selling them as well. But I actually thought it up myself
despite other doing the same. This was a "princess cake" in the words
full form as we did a Swedish princess cake in the form of a princess.

The process here is drastically different and dictated a new shift as
this was the last" time we did a multistory cake. The second cake was
designed by my sister (who has more experience) and I thinks hers was
better looking but not as spectacular (the doll stands out in a crowd).

2014, Sofia 2 years old

The last cake was the one we did this year for Sofia.
And I don't mean last as in the last we will ever make but more like the
last thus far. The theme was Hello Kitty and we ended up doing both a
hello kitty cake and a hello Kitty Cake topper (which we actually did
not top the cake with).

The cake was raspberry with marzipan cover and the topper was made out
of sugarpaste and rice-crispy bars. Since my sisters children (which are
lactose intolerant) we again ended up doing multiple cakes but opted for
the same cake twice. Interestingly enough the cakes ended up having very
little in decorations on them which was not the plan. But I think it
looked quite nice as they were and never felt the need to add more
"stuff" which is also why ultimately we ended up putting the topper on
the side. So perhaps less really is more.

The death of kitty
------------------

An interesting fact is that the head of kitty was a bit on the heavy
side so at the end of the day the weight had dislodge and I found her on
the stove leaning back heavily with a chopped of head... An apparent
spontaneous suicide me thinks...
