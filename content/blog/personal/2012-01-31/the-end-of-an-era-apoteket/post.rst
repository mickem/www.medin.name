Is it possible to summarizing
two years of Apoteket with a handful of music tracks?

Music has always been an important influence to me. I tend to emote
strongly by listening to music. Unfortunately emotions are not, for me,
really in the public domain so I will probably never share that here.

.. PELICAN_END_SUMMARY

So what can I do instead?

Well, taking the easy (read ironic) door I decided to list some music
which in various ways represents much of what happened at Apoteket. The
idea was born really from the first segment as it is a nice mix of “my
music” and what I expect would be considered “their music” (With them
being the team from Oracle SSI India).

Offshore, near-shore, no-shore!
===============================

So the most obvious thing I noticed at Apoteket was that it was the
first true offshore as well as near shore project for me. We not only
had Indians and Polish people in my team we also had a lot of them in
other teams which we worked with as well.

For me this was a mixed bag I have met some really really good people
with very impressive skills as well as some really terrible ones. But on
the whole I think offshoring really is difficult if you are lucky (or
perhaps skilled) you will have great success and if you are not:
catastrophe.

So which music shall represent India and Offshore then? Well obviously
it has to be `end.user <http://sonicterror.pressplatform.com/>`__ and
`Switch <http://open.spotify.com/track/4E78nycSvu65aevSTOfeMv>`__ a
break-core (ish) version of a song from the Bollywood movie Arzoo.

end.user - Switch

We also had some near shoring but I cant for the life of me find
something Polish so I have to skip that one. But speaking of countries
apart from India and Poland we also had quite a few other ones
represented. A bunch of people from the USA, Some from the Netherlands,
yet more from Malaysia and lets not forget our neighbors in Finaland,
Norway and Denmark. But perhaps more importantly one Italian guy with
whom I worked quite a lot and given that I essentially only know one
group from Italy (ish) I guess I am stuck with
`Klangstabil <http://www.klangstabil.com/>`__ and one of the few tracks
which are (I think) in Italian I will go with `perdere per
vincere <http://open.spotify.com/track/2JCHq7E4nI1uHlnp1hgbys>`__ (and
no I have no idea at all what the song is about).

Klangstabil–Perdere per vincere

Alien Monster (AM) Team
=======================

Sometimes working with various parts of the various teams and projects
at Apoteket I felt pretty much like screaming like the protagonist of
this next song: “What do you want from me?” This song will also step up
the pace a bit with some solid Norwegian EBM. As for which project and
which organization I leave that as an exercise to the reader.

So here we go `Pantzer AG <http://www.myspace.com/panzerag>`__
(**WARNING MySpace**) `Filth
God <http://open.spotify.com/track/6bg2E3iGJlZrGE0gJlSddf>`__.

Pantzer AG – Filth God

Another word I guess I would use for this whilst keeping the pace is I
guess `S.K.E.T. <www.sket-hq.de>`__ since they have an amazing song
called Center of Evil but alas that is not to be found on neither
Youtube nor Spotify. So instead of the planned social commentary on
American foreign policy in the post-911 era we wend up with some
political commentary in regards to the American foreign policy in the
gulf war called Is the Baby Normal. It is still rock solid power noise
though so a feast for the ears!

S.K.E.T. – Is the Baby Normal

Longest project like…ever?
==========================

This could in fact be the longest project ever for me. I have not kept
count and possibly SvK and KAII was longer but with close to two year it
is by far one of the longest projects for me. And given the some-times
rather hectic schedule I felt that the best representation would be
`Faithless <http://faithless.co.uk/>`__ and
`Insomnia <http://open.spotify.com/track/0J4aeU5RjeYdfyHqRKtF8Z>`__ as
the `Monster
Mix <http://open.spotify.com/track/0J4aeU5RjeYdfyHqRKtF8Z>`__ clock in
at 8:42 but since I got bored with static images I figured I’d go for
the music video version instead which is considerably shorter (and not
nearly as good).

Faithless – Insomnia

Then of course we have the fact that we some times cheat when we do AIA
and we often make things much much simpler so in that regard we are
Rebels right? WHich brings us to the next video. This one is still
steady in the electronica genre but perhaps a bit more danceable (though
I would probably dance to all of them under the right circumstance). So
representing our aprach to AIA: `Alice in
Videoland <http://www.myspace.com/aliceinvideoland>`__ (**WARNING:
Myspace link**) `We are
Rebels <http://open.spotify.com/track/4YiWeOvUOy24wAMl1EUrJX>`__. I will
not comment on the video suffice to say this is not how it looks when I
am out riding the trails… it is how I **wish** it would look |Ler|

Alice in Videoland – We are Rebels (ish)

Software Piracy!
================

One of the common reoccurring themes of conversation was software piracy
(as there seems to be quite a few shady people working for certain
companies). Myself I have a rather strict policy in software piracy
(especially since I spent a fortune on both movies, music, books and
games. I sort of have to defend the expense in some way right?

And the natural song to represent this is of course `Weird Al
Yankovic <http://www.weirdal.com/>`__ and Don’t Download this song. If
nothing else both the song and video are epic… EPIC!

Weird Al Yankovic – Don’t Download This Song

So the other aspect of the Apoteket project is I guess my role at Oracle
and why I quit. Once I started to ponder this I first went with
`Grendel <http://www.grendel-base.com/>`__ and `Chemical +
Circuitry <http://open.spotify.com/track/5ZpTEsKia9uEBmbqc3TM50>`__
mainly due to the intro which is from A Scanner Darkly. But then a
though struck me, almost an old classic, Banished from
`Hocico <http://www.hocico.com/>`__. Or perhaps even
`Wounds <http://open.spotify.com/track/3fV1B1VuiWv2XZkSR6lp0w>`__. But
for me
`Banished <http://open.spotify.com/track/1bNvbiTW1LL1waNgWeL4pM>`__ has
always been one of the best song from
`Hocico <http://www.hocico.com/>`__. It really has the pure darkness,
rage and desperation which only `Hocico <http://www.hocico.com/>`__ can
manifest.

Hocico – Banished

Departure Plan!
===============

This section is dedicated to Oracles amazing Departure Plan (or lack
there of) after I handed in my resignation (I actually notified them
more then a month prior to handing in my resignation). Their general
policy was pretty much that of a ostrich: “Lets not tell Apoteket and
hope they will not notice it”. This was never really a big problem for
me (and I wont inflate my self worth my saying that it was a big deal
for Apoteket either) but I would have felt happier with a slightly
better handover to “Henrik Brokvist” whom they found in the last few
days. But I feel pretty comfortable leaving them in his very capable
hands. So which song do we get? Well felt it was time to switch genre a
bit and thus I will go with `Soilwork <http://www.soilwork.org/>`__ and
`Departure
Plan <http://open.spotify.com/track/6i9JWjjQn14SutiCvfV98w>`__.

Soilwork – Departure Plan

And so now we are need something to finish it all of right? Something
epic something of a statement… maybe even leaving on a positive note?

I would like to finish then by saying this has been one of the most fun
projects – period! And I can but hope that I will again work with such
crafty and ingenious people with such a good team spirit and such grand
goals, such … perfection lacking a better description. So that’s pretty
much leaves us with some nice trance from one of the best DJs: `DJ
Tiësto <http://www.tiesto.com>`__ (**WARNING Annoying background
music**). I was aiming for `Love Comes
again <http://open.spotify.com/track/0Ks5uSTQK9CMUqYRP4somV>`__ but I
felt that was a bit too much so instead we end up with `Forver
Today <http://open.spotify.com/track/3S0wSAMSkTjb6FRKchN74Q>`__.

Tiësto – Forver Today

Locust!
=======

Now I was really angling for having `Machine
Head <http://machinehead1.com/>`__ and
`Locust <http://open.spotify.com/track/366MrjrvdvzAO3CVDduAnt>`__ in
here but alas I failed to find a reason to motivate it… so you get it as
a bonus song… amazing tune all in all… I have listened to it a lot
lately at Apoteket…

Machine Head – Locust
