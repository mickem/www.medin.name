I know I promised to continue the article about top CPU consumers. But I
was cleaning out some papers and found some printed code from when I was
a bit younger then I am now. So I decided to post pone that for another
day (hopefully tomorrow or day after).

Anyways it is interesting how the world has changed, yet everything
seems  stay the same.

.. PELICAN_END_SUMMARY

Rewind the clock some 20 years or so and I was
already coding. I started out in the late 80s I guess coding basic which
sort of sucked because
`GW-basic <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GW-BASIC>`__ (and later on
`Qbasic <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBasic>`__) was never very good
for making graphic games. And after having played classics like
`Q-bird <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q*bert>`__ and later on
`Larry <http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leisure_Suit_Larry_in_the_Land_of_the_Lounge_Lizards>`__
really begged for more than Qbasics famous
`Gorila <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorillas_(video_game)>`__ game
could deliver.

So by accident I got my hands on some
`Assembler <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Macro_Assembler>`__
books and I was instantly hooked!

I spent hours and hours coding away in assembler but alas this was
before the age of `github <http://github.com/>`__ and even subversion so
by now all the code is lost.

But fortunately thanks to the magic of paper I found some old code
sheets which I had backed up through my printer.

Well documented code
====================

The interesting thing is that I wrote rather well documented code (which
I guess was a necessity since assembler is a tad on the unreadable
side).

I was seriously sad though since I had this “cool” thing going on with
rather embarrassing aliases and such. Hell we eventually even ended up
having our own fake “cult” on IRC just to make us feel special. By cult
here I mean me and some other guys waving fancy handles around trying to
speak speak medieval English.

And for some strange bizarre reason I had some ascii art arrows going
along all the bulk instructions. Had to have been seriously difficult to
keep that up. Or maybe I had some strange
`brief <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brief_(text_editor)>`__ macro for
it?

The only living remains
=======================

The only remains from this era in electronic form is a single “demo” I
did which started out which some nifty flame plasma over text where you
could select which graphics card you had.

Well, so much for the old days, maybe I shall apply some OCR to the
source code and try to compile it?

Anyways, time to end this post and get some shut-eye so I can write the
real post tomorrow about `Lua <http://www.lua.org/>`__ scripts for
`NSClient++ <http://nsclient.org/>`__.
