Spent three days this week at
`JFokus <http://www.jfokus.se/>`__ so I thought I’d share my views a
bit. To be honest the conference was a bit on the lighter side and I
think in hindsight I did a really botched job selecting sessions. I
managed to pick both some very amazing sessions as well as a lot of
introductions, sales pitches or things I already knew.

.. PELICAN_END_SUMMARY

|Pengar|\ |Somnig| Spring into the Cloud
----------------------------------------

Josh Long and Chris Richardson from
`SpringSource <http://www.springsource.com/>`__
(`VMware <http://www.vmware.com/>`__) did a talk about `Spring
Foundry <http://www.springfoundry.com/>`__ and Spring. Unfortunately the
first half of the talk was mainly sales slides about `Spring
Foundry <http://www.springfoundry.com/>`__. In other words dreadfully
boring and uninteresting (unless you are planning to start using `Spring
Foundry <http://www.springfoundry.com/>`__ I guess). Second half was a
bit more interesting where he detailed some “cloud related” spring
technologies such as AMQP and how to handle NoSQL databases. In essence
for me it was pretty much a waste of time.

***This was rated as Introduction (|Flicka|) but I would rate it as
Sales pitch (|Pengar|).***

|Ninja|\ |Ler| CQRS & Event Sourcing, a crash course
----------------------------------------------------

Greg Young did an amazing job both describing the patterns but also in
telling fascinating and relevant stories to explain and put it all in to
perspective. all in all this was one of the best session at
`JFokus <http://www.jfokus.se/>`__. As an interesting side note one can
add that he did the talk without using a microphone.

***This was not rated but I would rate it as Intermediate (|Ninja|).***

|Pengar|\ |Somnig| Enterprise Java in 2012 and Beyond
-----------------------------------------------------

Juergen Hoeller from Spring (VMware) did another sales pitch spending a
lot of time “Oracle/Java”-bashing whilst sort of (if not directly)
pitching how Spring solves the slowness of Javas development process.

***This was rated as intermediate (|Ninja|) but I would rate it as Sales
pitch (|Pengar|).***

|Ninja|\ |Ler| A JVM Does What?
-------------------------------

|IMAG0165|\ Cliff Click from `Azul
Systems <http://www.azulsystems.com/>`__ did a great job explaining how
the JVM works and some of the problems which Oracle struggles with and
of course some tidbits about how Azul has improved them. All in all very
interesting and excellent speaker. And with a stage name like Cliff
Click how can you go wrong.

***This was rated as intermediate (|Ninja|) and I would agree.***

|Flicka|\ |Ler| Maven vs Gradle, On your marks, get set, go!
------------------------------------------------------------

Hardy Ferentschik from `Red Hat <http://www.redhat.com/>`__ did a great
job explaining both how `Maven <http://maven.apache.org/>`__ and
`Gradle <http://gradle.org/>`__ works but also the problems of both of
them. This was a very good session without any real favor either way
(though they had opted for `Gradle <http://gradle.org/>`__ after giving
up on `Maven <http://maven.apache.org>`__).

***This was rated as introduction (|Flicka|) and I would agree.***

|Pengar|\ |Somnig| JDK 7 Updates & JDK 8
----------------------------------------

Dalibor Topic from `Oracle <http://oracle.com/>`__ did a pretty ok job
trying to explain the Java road map. Unfortunately this is nothing new
and most of it this was essentially just another sales pitch thing
without any real development content. Towards the end he actually showed
some code in the form of Lambdas and what not but given all the hype we
have seen it many times before (also pretty much all other languages
already has them in some form or another so the concept is not very new
either).

    ***This was rated as intermediate (|Ninja|) but I would rate it as
    Sales pitch (|Pengar|).***

|Flicka|\ |Ler| Stop sleeping, start awaiting!
----------------------------------------------

Johan Haleby from `Jayway <http://www.jayway.com/>`__ did a pretty
decent job explaining
`Awaitility <http://code.google.com/p/awaitility/>`__ a java framework
for introducing waits into unit tests. Unfortunately this was a strange
extremely short “coffee session” and with only 15 minutes he did not
have time to go too deep. I would have loved for him to continue sharing
some real world insight into unit testing and how to solve real works
problems.

***This was rated as introduction (|Flicka|) something I would agree
with.***

|Flicka|\ |Somnig| Tuning the HotSpot JVM's Garbage Collectors
--------------------------------------------------------------

Angelika Langer from `Angelika
Langer <http://www.angelikalanger.com/>`__ Training/Consulting did a
very good job explaining how garbage collection works inside the hotspot
JVM. Unfortunately given the title I was expecting rather more which was
not really delivered so for me (who already know how the garbage
collection works) it was not very to interesting.

***This was rated as intermediate (|Ninja|) but I would rate this as
introduction (|Flicka|).***

|Tänker|\ |Ler| Comparing JVM Web Frameworks
--------------------------------------------

Matt Raible from `Raible Designs <http://raibledesigns.com/>`__ did
great job explaining some thoughts about choosing a web frame-work. Not
really sure what the take away was as he was all over the place but it
was interesting. Not sure about rating nothing was very advanced so I am
sort of doubting the intermediate score but it was not really an
introduction either.

***This was rated as intermediate (|Ninja|) and I am unsure how to rate
this.***

|red-heart| Nightly sessions
----------------------------

|IMAG0170|\ Since it was valentines day (***|red-heart|***) I took the
mature decision to leave for home and family instead of staying around
at the bar (|Brustet hjärta|) but according to the schedule they had a
few BoFs going and what not and for all I know this was very good (or
not)…

|Flicka|\ |Somnig| Functional Thinking
--------------------------------------

Neal Ford from `ThoughtWorks, Inc <http://www.thoughtworks.com/>`__ did
a great job introducing functional programming and what is different.
But I took the required course on Haskell at the university so I have
already been introduced to Functional programming. This session would
probably be very very interesting if you have never programmed
Functional before. And I know at the university this was really a game
changer for me, I usually claim Haskell as the most insightful course at
the university. Fortunately Neal Ford is a both skilled and amusing
presenter so it was a very enlightening talk. Now how someone can rate
an “introduction to …” as intermediate is beyond me.

***This was rated as intermediate (|Ninja|) but I would rate this as
introduction (|Flicka|).***

|Tänker|\ |Ler| Tackling Android fragmentation
----------------------------------------------

Glenn Bech from `Inmeta Consulting
AS <http://www.inmetacrayon.no/Norsk/om_inmeta_crayon/selskapene/Pages/Inmeta-Consulting-AS.aspx>`__
did a quick introduction to the various problems you face when you write
programs which has to work on all the different Android devices out
there. As Android comes on everything from cheep phones which very low
resolution screens to big tablets with very high-resolution screen.

***This was rated as intermediate (|Ninja|) and I am unsure how to rate
this.***

|Ninja|\ |Ler| The Art of (Java) Benchmarking
---------------------------------------------

Cliff Click from `Azul Systems <http://www.azulsystems.com/>`__ did
another nice presentation describing some of the challenges making Java
benchmarks. Mainly the problem is the rather erratic and unexpected
behavior of JIT compilation which turns many benchmarks into
nothingness. Very interesting and very insightful and as with his
previous presentation very nicely presented. The ending was amazing, he
might have told a joke, but no one got it and silence spread throughout
the crowd for several minutes and whilst we were leaving I kept asking
my self: Did we breach social etiquette or did he |Ler|

***This was rated as intermediate (|Ninja|) and I would agree with
this.***

|Ninja|\ |Somnig| It Is Possible to Do Object-Oriented Programming in Java
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Kevlin Henney from `Curbralan <http://curbralan.com/>`__ did a nice and
entertaining talk about what Object Oriented programming really is. I
guess the intermediate classification comes from the rather academic way
Kevlin presented the material citing  numerous papers and using
“complicated math” to make his points. But it was very entertaining and
insightful.

***This was rated as intermediate (|Ninja|) and I would agree with
this.***

|Ninja|\ |Somnig| What to Expect from HotRockit
-----------------------------------------------

Marcus Hirt from `Oracle <http://oracle.com/>`__ previously Bea
presented essentially some of the nice features of
`JRockit <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/middleware/jrockit/overview/index.html>`__
which are now being merged into Hotspot. This would have been very
interesting had I not taken a course on exactly this topic back when it
was “just”
`JRockit <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/middleware/jrockit/overview/index.html>`__.
So unfortunately for me this was repetition. But apart from that a nice
session and I still think
`JRockit <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/middleware/jrockit/overview/index.html>`__
is awesome! Sadly though mission control will still require a license
even after it's migrated over to Hotspot.

***This was rated as intermediate (|Ninja|) and I would agree with
this.***

|Flicka|\ |Ler| We visualized, we saw, we changed
-------------------------------------------------

Leonard Axelsson from `Mojang <http://www.mojang.com/>`__ did another of
the short strange sessions. And since I am into monitoring I had to go.
He did a pretty ok introduction to why everyone should monitor and also
`Graphite <http://graphite.wikidot.com/>`__. Unfortunately it was again
a short session but hopefully he managed to open a few eyes. I have
always felt that monitoring is a difficult subject to breach and most
companies don’t do it at all. Or to be exact the monitoring department
does baseline HW/OS monitoring but no application monitoring.

***This was rated as introduction (|Flicka|) and I would agree with
this.***

|Arbete| CLOSING KEYNOTE: Cool Code
-----------------------------------

Kevlin Henney from `Curbralan <http://curbralan.com/>`__ was doing a
talk on “Cool Code” unfortunately I headed on home to do some work
(|Arbete|) instead so I missed it.

Summary
-------

I think all in all I did a terrible job selecting session on
`JFokus <http://www.jfokus.se/>`__. I normally go to monitoring
conferences as that is my hobby and there I tend to always learn new
things but this was mainly repetition and things I already know. So I
often felt I could have stayed at home instead and done something
useful. And when it came to “Conferences are all about interaction and
Social” I have to say I meet very few people from earlier assignments
and such actually. And the once I did meet seemed to have a similar
experience so the big question is where was everyone? Of course most
people from `Mejsla <http://www.mejsla.se/>`__ were there and given that
I am new there it is always nice to hang out a bit with the co-workers.

But all in all I have to say that with half the session tagged with the
sleepy face I felt this was a bit of a waste of time. Hopefully once the
recordings are out I will discover some of the interesting sessions I
hope I missed.

And I hope for next year that `JFokus <http://www.jfokus.se/>`__ does a
better job of splitting the conference up into introduction (|Flicka|)
and intermediate (|Ninja|) and making the intermediate (|Ninja|)
sessions intermediate (|Ninja|) and not introduction (|Flicka|).
