Some short reflections from
`radars <http://radareco.se/>`__ event `Integrate 2
Innovate <http://radari2i.se/>`__ last week where I held a presentation
about Continuous Delivery.

.. PELICAN_END_SUMMARY

The conference was an interesting conference mainly in how different it
was from many other events I have spoken at. I had been warned before
that the "logistics might be a bit bad" which was a bit of an
understatement. The first thing I noticed was that there were no signs
at all when I entered the hotel lobby. I had to go ask the bell hop
where the conference was. This went on there were no signs anywhere and
given that the venue stretched over three floors with a lot of hallways
and rooms-inside-rooms finding my way was extremely difficult. There
were a lot of little annoying things like this which really got me
thinking. I really should reach out more to the extremely competent
people in Bolzano, Nuremberg etc who always arranges superb conferences.
Apparently it is more difficult then it seems to get a conference to
running smoothly.

But logistics aside the event was pretty nice and I had a great time. My
talk, about Continuous Delivery (in enterprise development and
integration), was well received and the room was full with some people
standing at the back. Now this might sound grand but does not really
mean anything since the rooms was pretty small (60 people tops) but
still: nice to talk to a full room. What has really nice though was that
a lot of people came up afterwards and we had some great
discussions. This I think is really the best way to measure success.

Payed advertisements?
---------------------

Another interesting reflection is that my company payed around $6.000 or
$12.000 dollars to be at the conference. And while my talk is not
advertisements for our company or our services a lot of the other talks
were direct advertisements for various services and products.Now this in
it self is nothing strange right? If companies have spent a lot of money
to be here they would be expected to create a bit of a buzz right?

The problem here is that the participants have also payed to be at the
conference. So they shell out around $1000 dollar per head and for that
they get to listen to payed advertisements? Sounds a bit off to me.
Personally I believe that the free speaker model is better where
speakers do not pay to come and instead (hopefully) have something to
say.

Chinese proverbs and the Obama campaign
---------------------------------------

Unfortunately I missed large parts of the conference partly as I wanted
to rehearse in the real room as well as I opted to hang around our booth
for a bit. But I did see the intro section which was mainly about the
usual buzzwords: mobile, cloud, social etc. On guy from IBM had a really
interesting talk where he explained how Obama had won the last election
by exploiting social and analytics. He opened the talk with a
(`fake <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_you_live_in_interesting_times>`__)
Chinese curse: "May you live in interesting times" but it really
bothered me that he did not end with the obvious "In china the word for
danger and opportunity" is the same (which is also fake). Instead he
went with "and your interesting times will be great" or something like
that. A really missed opportunity. But that aside the talk was
excellent. I also caught a few other talks which was interesting but
nothing which really stood out.

The room I spoke in was, as I said before, a bit small but what really
bothered me was that it had a very very cramped stage area so I had to
hide behind the podium pretty much all my talk. My presentation
style tends to be active so getting bogged down always makes me feel
cramped. Which is why I really love Bolzano which has a really big
stage. interestingly enough I never wonder to far as I need to see my
monitor so I can cheat and see whats up next. So it is more mental then
a real annoyance I think.
