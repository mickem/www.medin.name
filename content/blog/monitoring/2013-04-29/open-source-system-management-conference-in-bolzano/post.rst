I attended the conference for the third time and as always
the weather in Bolzano in conjunction with a nice conference made for a
great time. I have already mentioned my experiences with the `hotel in a
previous post <http://blog.medin.name/?p=901>`__ so here I will focus
mainly on the conference itself and my trip.

.. PELICAN_END_SUMMARY

The trip
--------

|DSC05209|\ The conference from my view point started with me heading
out to Arlanda airport about an hour and a half ahead of the departure
time. Now due to some technical issues with all their fancy check-in
computers there was a huge line and rather slow progress so all in all
it took almost an hour for me to leave my bag. rather stressed I ran as
fast as I could through security and arrived at the designated gate some
10 minutes prior to departure. And lo and behold my surprise when I
noticed the gate was not boarding? So I quickly look at the computer
screen which says Frankfurt and not Linarte. This was followed by
verifying my boarding card where I notice it also says Frankfurt.

Since I was at the gate I asked the staff why I was not going to Linate
and they looked in their computers to discover that my plane was
canceled and I had been rerouted via Frankfurth. What I found the
staggering is that no one even mentioned this at check-in.

Apart from that the trip worked out nicely and I arrived safely at my
hotel around midnight.

The spare day
-------------

|DSC05006|\ Already upon arrival the day before I had started to suspect
the weather was spectacular and the next day proved this to be very true
as the temperature reached 27 degrees with content sunshine I really
really wished I would have had the time to spend a week there
vacationing. Bolzano is as always a very beautiful place and I really
enjoy it immensely.

After arriving I Since I had a spare day (just-in-case) but not much
time I was planning to work most of the day which I did after some
initial excursions to shop for souvenirs and to buy a new mouse since I
had forgotten mine. This all seemed like a nice idea apart from the lack
of AC made working at the hotel a bit difficult.

The Conference
--------------

|DSC05108|\ The conference itself was a rather positive surprise. I am a
tech guy and find sales and management speeches rather boring so I have
always been a bit surprised that they have this conference which is a
bit of a mix between tech, sales and management. But this year they had
some very very interesting speeches starting off very strong with a set
of presentations more about open source in general and the difficulty in
selling open source to corporations.

|DSC05077|\ First we had `John M.
Weathersby <https://twitter.com/jmwossi>`__ who was very American, he
came from New Orleans and had a rather strong southern accent and an
avid proponent of Free Guns rights and defender of the second amendment.
His presentation was about the difficulty in selling Open Source to the
American government which was why he had formed the Open Source Software
Institute to help projects with overcoming the barrier required to sell
to governments. One such issue was getting
`openssl <http://www.openssl.org>`__ FIPS certified. Quite interesting
stuff and an extremely positive start for this conference.

|DSC05090|\ Second presentation was by `Al
Gillen <https://twitter.com/algillen>`__ from IDC who talked about
uptake and acceptance of Open Source software with a surprisingly large
focus on Open Source Management. One very interesting fact was the
comparison of time it took for an Open Source Software to become
accepted. Which 10-20 years ago was over 10 years but for many modern
projects was now less then 2-3 years. Again I was extremely surprised of
the quality of the presentations which thus far was much much better
then any other Open Source Conference Management/Monitoring I have
attended.

|DSC05111|\ After the coffee break was a return to the normality with an
Italian (Giuseppe Arrabito) speaker doing a very Italian presentation.
Once he get past thanking people and doing the obligatory video advert
for his company (a University), well 15 minutes into the presentation,
he spoke about how they had implemented various tools (hint neteye) at
the university. I think the most interesting bit from my viewpoint was
the difference between Swedish universities and the university in Rome,
Luleå has maybe 20.000 students if they count in all satellite campuses
where as Rome has 150.000 (about twice the population of Luleå).

|DSC05134|\ The last presentation before lunch was by my good friend
Georg Kostner of `Würth Phoenix <http://www.wuerth-phoenix.com/en/>`__.
His presentation was of their user statistics toolkit which read traffic
data from the network and produced metrics relating to response times
and such from the end users perspective.

Quite interesting stuff but I could not help my self of thinking about
an `Oracle <http://oracle.com/>`__ tool called Real User Experience
Insight which I believe is rather similar in nature. Interestingly he
plugged `NSClient++ <http://nsclient.org/>`__ a bit as they seemed to
use it a bit internally.

Next up was lunch break and some time for me to collect my stuff and
make some last minute tweaks to the slides.

|DSC05148|\ Next up was another Italian Presentation.This time by
`Alessio Cuppari <https://twitter.com/AlessioCuppari>`__ who were from
`DigiCamere <http://www.digicamere.it/>`__ which I gather is the
equivalence to the chamber of commerce in Italy. IN regular Italian
fashion he spent almost half the presentation setting the stage by
explaining what they were doing which was interesting but not really my
cup of tea. The reminder was spent explaining how they implemented OTRS.

|DSC05163|\ Then we had a Polish re-seller of NetEye called Grzegorz
Walicki. A rather strange presentation all-in-all his message seemed to
be that Poland is a nice country to outsource to. This means he spent
the most part of his presentation throwing statistics and financial
numbers around which is definitely no my cup of tea.

|DSC05171|\ Then was `me <https://twitter.com/mickem>`__! My
presentation was (I sadly have to admit) a bit of a re-run of what I did
at Open Source Monitoring Conference. But for the first time I did
actually get some laughs from an audience in Italy so my idea with
graphical jukes worked. This is what is the biggest challenge with the
Italian conference: since it is all translated to Italian and German it
is very difficult to get feedback from the crowd since everything is
delayed and slightly incorrect once it gets to the crowd.

|DSC05183|\ After my presentation the “\ `NeDi <http://www.nedi.ch/>`__
guy” Remo Rickli was showing off his tool and again I was struck by how
cool it is. It is strange that not more people use
`NeDi <http://www.nedi.ch/>`__ since it is a very capable tool with some
really cool features. For those who do not know NeDi is an SNMP
do-it-all tool based around inventory but it goes far beyond that. It
also feature some non-SNMP based protocol as well.

|DSC05191|\ The last presentation was probably the coolest and most
interesting as Stefano Traverso talked about challenges in understanding
what people use the internet for and how to create tools which can
predict and notify when infrastructure break down. It was insane to hear
the massive amount of data they were looking at in real time.

After all the presentations were done they did a massive group photo of
all the attendants (who were left). This was followed by the usual
speakers dinner which was very nice indeed. And naturally the dinner was
followed by the after-party where I managed to get drunk without paying
for a single beer (sorry guys, I’ll make sure I will grab the first few
rounds next year :)).
