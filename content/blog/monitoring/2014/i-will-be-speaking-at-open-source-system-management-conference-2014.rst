I will be speaking at the Open Source System Management Conference Â in
Bolzano this year which is held at Sheraton on April 10.

My presentation will be about: "Why we do monitoring Wrong!" which is
something I am rather passionate about and I will hopefully inspire some
of you to drastically change how you do monitoring! I don't want to
spoil anything but the future will eventually catch up with us...

.. PELICAN_END_SUMMARY

Other prominent speakers is Andreas Ericsson from
`Op5 <http://www.op5.com>`__\ and previously
`Nagios <http://www.nagios.org>`__\ Core developer who masterminded the
rather spectacular Nagios fork `Naemon <http://www.naemon.org/>`__\ last
fall. But also Forrester Reasearch is there and (which I misinterpreted
to be the same in the video) a guy nick named "Mad Dog" as well as the
usual suspects.

The intro
---------

Since they forced me to do one of them horrible video teasers (I always
feel like an idiot speaking on video) you can see my self look like an
idiot here:

Bolzano
-------

And as I always say, Bolzano is amazingly beautiful and always worth a
visit. So if you are not interested in the conference go anyway and
spend a few days in the sunny hills of Bolzano. It is always perfect
sunshine in Bolzano, I have been there several times now and never had
even a cloudy sky, always sunshine...
