Well, this is an odd post. I find it difficult to start to be honest.
How do I write about my adventures without it sounding strange or
bizarre? But perhaps it needs to sounds bizarre for that was how it felt
to me. I know this is all a gag but it is interesting how well my mind
failed to understand that at the time.

.. PELICAN_END_SUMMARY

The conference I question is of course the Illustrious `Open Source
Monitoring Conference <http://www.netways.de/osmc/>`__ which I have
visited for many years now but given that it is arranged by one of the
coolest company in the Computing industry
`Netways <http://www.netways.de/>`__ is always a bit special… even more
so this year.

Conferencing Netways Style!
===========================

I had actually been given some basic advance knowledge that there was
something to expect on arriving in Nuremberg this year.

Last year we joked about it and a few weeks before the conference
`Bernd <https://twitter.com/gethash>`__ insisted on getting my arrival
time.

But I was expecting a shabby cab driver with a badly typed sign and
black cab not…. **not this…**

Upon arriving I pickup my luggage and head out through the exit and…and…
there are people with video cameras all over the place!

I go like “ ** What the F*ck?**” while time seems to slow down I scan the area for
something I can grab on to. But all I can see are the two pretty girls
standing in front of a big rollup as well as
`Bernd <https://twitter.com/gethash>`__ standing off to the side and the
cameras.

But unfortunately the girls and what presumably is their mind control
rays are somehow blocking the content of the roll-up from registering
with my mind. I can only see the pretty girls… cameras and
`Bernd <https://twitter.com/gethash>`__ off to the side.

My brain seems to freeze and I just sort of stand there not knowing what
to do. Should I go for the unknown pretty girls or way off to the side
to `Bernd <https://twitter.com/gethash>`__ or somehow one of the camera
guys?

|_MG_7971b| I kept thinking… no one teaches you how to act such a
situation. There are no classes at `university <http://www.ltu.se/>`__
for how to act when you’re at the very center of the stage. No books on
`safari-books-online <http://www.safaribooksonline.com/>`__, not even
any of the self-help books from `Pragmatic
Publishing <http://www.pragprog.com/>`__ prepares you for this.

And while standing there I can somehow remember thinking that I really
should look cool because I am being videotaped… not so… Instead I stand
there looking much like a dork.

Fortunately someone realizes my predicament and comes to my rescue me
and apparently I was supposed to go for the girls. Once this mental
block is released I can actually see that the roll-up is a big photo of
me saying “Welcome”.

Ironically enough the sign is like I imagined it to be: misspelt (or
more likely mistranslated by `Google <http://www.google.com>`__ since it
is in Swedish) so my vision of the cabby with a sign was not too far off
really. Except the cabby was two pretty girls and the bad sign was a
professionally done roll-up. Yes, and the car was about thrice as long…

A ride to remember
==================

|DSC07325| After taking some photos of the roll-up I pose for some
photographs and then head on out, escorted by the pretty girls, to the
awaiting limousine. Again I manage to snap some photos before entering
the dark limousine with the girls in tow. Inside they have some shady
LED lights and you can barely make out anything so I spend a few minutes
trying to navigate the myriad of buttons but none seem to turn on the
lights. And then off the limousine goes.

Once again I get this odd thoughts:

 | What you actually do in a dark limousine
 | alone with two pretty girls?

|DSC07321| Fortunately (for the sake of my sanity) the answer is not
much really, at least in my case, we just spend the next ten minutes or
so chatting about nothing.

After a while on of the girls offer to serve me some beverage. Naturally
going for the champagne but after some quick math I realize that in 10
minutes I cannot really down a bottle of champagne so instead I opt for
a beer. After getting a glass handed to me I attempt to return the
courtesy but alas one of the girls is Muslim (and don’t drink) and the
other is driving home which means I am the only one getting any beer
tonight…

After arriving at the usual hotel there is some more video recording and
photo-shoots and someone from the hotel manages to sneak up and grab my
bags.

After getting a bit bored with posing and photo session I asked if the
pretty girls were up for dinner but alas not, instead we said good bye
and they head on home.

A night of Hellos
=================

After I bid the pretty girls farewell I head off for my room (which is
of course a suite) and dump my luggage after which I head down to the
evening hall and have dinner.

The food is, as always, nice and tasty and I find some nice company and
spend the dinner amiably chatting with my neighbors at the table having
a great time.

One of the table neighbors is the illustrious `Alan
Robertson <https://twitter.com/@OSSAlanR>`__ who promises to take over
the world… `before handing out
stickers <http://linux-ha.org/source-doc/assimilation/html/index.html>`__.

Even later that night I head over to the bar to rendezvous with all the
usual suspects which now includes a new
member:  `Pall <https://twitter.com/pallsigurdsson>`__ from Iceland who
I meet at the `Nagios World
Conference <www.nagios.com/events/nagiosworldconference/northamerica/2013>`__
earlier this year as well as all the regular ones from conferences past.

    The best thing about `Open Source monitoring
    Conference <http://www.netways.de/osmc/>`__ is really that it is one
    big happy family.

We spent the reminder of the evening chatting, drinking beer and having
a great time!

Look! I’m on TV!
================

|CameraZOOM-20131023092624033| As always I head back early since I have
presentation the following day.

The conference starts off with the regular introduction which Bernd does
in English this year…and ends with a movie they put together about my
adventures the night before…

No matter how hard I try I can never shake the weird feeling spending a
brief few seconds midst giants like David Hasselhoff...

 | “Like David Hasselhoff;
 | I have now been famous in Germany”.

Next up is the actual review of the Conference, but that will have to
wait a bit…
