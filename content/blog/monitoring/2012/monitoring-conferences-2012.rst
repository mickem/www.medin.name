Well, since I got an email from Würth Phoenix asking me to plug their
conference Which has been renamed again this year calling itself Open
Source System Management Conference 2012. Ironically enough they forgot
to include the link making it a bit difficult to give some information
but a quick `google <http://www.google.com>`__ reviled this page
http://www.wuerth-phoenix.com/en/company/event/nagios-event/. Since I
figured it would be a dreadfully short blog post with just a single
conference I figured I’d mention the other once I know about as well.

.. PELICAN_END_SUMMARY

Open Source System Management Conference 2012
=============================================

**Italy, May**

Again it is held in may (May 10:th) and since I have been visiting the
last two years I can say it is a pretty nice Conference. It is also free
so if you are in the vicinity of Bolzano in may there is really no
reason not to go. I would say the conference has a more business
oriented focus then the much tech heavier one held by Netways later this
fall.

And as I said last year in my video plug the scenery and weather in
Bolzano in May is AMAZING! So even if you not in the neighborhood you
should go |Ler|

I would say the highlights this year (for me) would be:

-  Systems Management using Open Source
   Actual trends and strategies of well established and new platforms
   with Bernd Erk. Assuming it will not just be about Icinga |Ler|
-  Nagios in Cloud Computing Environments
   How effectively managing the cloud with focus on application and
   network performance with William Leibzon

But there is plenty of other things to choose from so be sure to check
out the agenda at

|IMAG0267|\ Nagios World Conference North America
=================================================

**USA, September**

Not much is known about the agenda for this year as it is a long way
off. But if the venue is the same as last year you HAVE TO GO! A truly
bizarre hotel with among other features ducks (the ones that go quack)
inside the hotel!

Well to be honest it was probably some other bird but given my limited
understanding of ornithology anything that swims and is not a swan is a
duck. (and these were neither white nor biting me so they can't have
been swans).

But ornithology aside last years sessions was very good and the evening
event was pretty cool as well. Cant say I liked Minneapolis too much but
I think that is more of a “US feature” then anything fundamentally wrong
with MSP. Since all the cities I have been in have been remarkably un
tourist-friendly.

Given that it is the only (?) Nagios World Conference this year it is
almost a given for any serious Nagios user. They have also extended the
conference to three days this year making it (presumably) even better
than last year. More details can be found here

Open Source Monitoring Conference 2012
======================================

**Germany, October**

As always (hey, this was my first ever conference talk!) Netways is
hosting OSMC in fall again as always. And what can I say: (not much
really since it is by far to early) but presumably it is the same place,
presumably the same excellent talks and presumably the same excellent
people! For me it is a given if you are into open source monitoring and
I have attended now for some five years or so I should know. I think the
only real bad thing about this conference is the location of the hotel
which is located smack in the middle of the red-light-district which
makes this the least family friendly conference of them all.

|DSC03240|\ As you can see from the photos I tend to spend my vacations
on various conferences instead of at the beach but alas this year we are
planning to actually have a real vacation so I am unsure if I will make
it…

I will definitely miss Bolzano this year due to some family
restructuring in May (se image on right) and might miss MSP in September
as that’s around when the vacation is planned leaves me with a potential
slot open for Nuremberg but alas if I have a regular vacation I might
not have any days off for going there either |Ledsen|

…but we shall see…we shall see…
