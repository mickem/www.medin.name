I was asked to present at
`OSMC <http://www.netways.de/en/osmc/osmc_2012/overview/>`__ in October
later this year and figured I would ask around a bit:

    **What would you like to hear me talk about?**

Now I figured I would also use this to see what kind of blog post I
shall write so two birds with one stone :)

.. PELICAN_END_SUMMARY

A few ideas I have for topics are:

-  **Real-time monitoring**
   I started to dabble a bit with real time monitoring when I
   wrote/talked about the real time event-log monitoring stuff I added
   to NSClient++. But the subject is much larger and there is a lot of
   other areas such as performance counters, disk/io as well as log
   monitoring (files not event log).
-  **The road ahead/Whats new (NSClient++).**
   This is to me always feel a bit cheep. Like I cant come up with a a
   topic so I tend to avoid it besides I did a lot of the "whats new"
   last year. But perhaps people think it is interesting?
-  **Extending NSClient++**
   NSClient++ can be extended with scripts but it is much
   more powerful then your normal scripting. There is also a myriad of
   ways it can be scripted and extended such as Lua, Python, dot-net etc
   etc.
-  **Monitoring Windows**
   Now this is a big topic and the reason I often avoid it is that you
   either make it to general by not speaking about X which means you end
   up with  "monitor disk, cpu and memory" or you make it to detailed
   meaning everyone thinks "but I don't use X".
-  **Configuration management with NSClient++ **
   Now this is a topic I think will become more and more interesting as
   the number of configuration options are exploding with more and more
   able versions.
-  **Java monitoring**
   This is something I would like to talk about since I am a Java
   developer and I did a talk about this a few years back but the main
   problem is the details will be very application server specific
   meaning you again end up with everyone thinking "I don't use X".
-  **Distributed monitoring**
   Again a topic I feel much about and I spoke a bit about it here and
   there last year so probably not for OSMC but maybe some blog posts?
-  **Monitoring Patterns**
   Now I am not a monitoring specialist but something I have
   been actively looking for are recipes and patterns for monitoring
   various things and I think it would be nice to start collecting
   various recipes for monitoring. Now this is (as I said) not really my
   field (I am more of an infrastructure guy) but perhaps I could start
   with what I know and see if we can get somewhere?
-  **Feel free to add you own ideas here!**
   Interact, get back to me, let me know what you think!
