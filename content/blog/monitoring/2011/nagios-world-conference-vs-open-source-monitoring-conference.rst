**A BIG DISCLAIMER: This is all nonsense… but…**

Since I was asked repeatedly at OSMC (Open Source Monitoring Conference)
by various people how the conference compared I figured I would (in the
spirit of me) do a bit of a spoof comparison. So please don’t take this
seriously…

.. PELICAN_END_SUMMARY


Tags\ |DSC02801|
================

First off the biggest change you will notice is of course the “I am
Michael” tag you get when you arrive, which like the sheep I am, I
parade around with.

If we look we will quickly see the NWC (Nagios World Conference) is
bigger. So the following question is bigger better, being from the US
Ethan obviously thinks so, but I am not American so I am not so sure.
The big benefit to the bigger one is name could be bigger making it
simpler for people to read but here NWC has botched it using most of the
available real-estate for a big white border. But on the other hand
Netways has botched by using only caps and a rather narrow font making
the name difficult to read at a casual glance.

Reversing the tag we find on the NWC one a lot of information where as
OSMC reversed is the same (which incidentally is more difficult then you
might think to achieve) The drawback to the NWC information page which
seems like a better option is the layout which feels both Spartan and
rather badly layouted (notice the  inconsistent white spaces).\ |OSMC-6|

**Winner this round: OSMC**

Mainly for the more professional tag and the ingenious idea of adding
stars (one for each year) to the tag

Folders\ |DSC02799|
===================

Seems a lot of conference nowadays hands out some form of folder to put
your papers in. Nagios here went all out giving us a fancy waterproof
zip-locked plastic thing.So one might be tempted to just blindly hand it
to NWC theirs was waay cooler. But unfortunately the coolness comes at a
price. From the end user perspective (me) It is much more difficult to
get papers in and out. it is also not very durable (meaning papers fold
easily) which I guess is the main point (to keep my papers nice,
organized and unfolded).\ |NWC-logo|

**Winner this round: NWC**

Mainly for the rather dashing all out plastic waterproof thingy.

Lanyards\ |DSC02807|
====================

Another one of these modern conferences thing is handing out lanyards
left and right. Both conference mainly used the lanyard for attaching
the tag to the neck (so no pin attachment option was available at either
conference). In all fairness neither of the lanyards was particularly
fancy (Oracle really has that lead). But Nagios went the cheaper route
and went with the most basic version (not even a proper non flex cord).
Netways on the other hand at least out a bit more effort into it having
a detachable part as well as the rather normal non-flex cord.

**Winner this round: OSMC**

Non of them were really spectacular and should perhaps say the looser
was Nagios for going with the cheaper then normal option.

|DSC02804|\ T-shirts
====================

Or rather lack of. Nagios had a pretty basic standard thing going with a
blue t-shirt with a black Nagios logo on the front and a rather
fashionable cog design thing on the back (in gray-white-black). They
opted for an American Apparel t-shirt with is ok, but after washing it a
few times it is showing signs of deformation.

On the other hand Netways really missed this golden opportunity to score
points as they provided no t-shirt at all.

**Winner this round: NWC**

Kind of hard to loose against no t-shirt at all I guess.

Internet
========

OSMC provide free internet access (WiFi) throughout the conference and
hotel rooms which is really neat and gives **you** ample time to slack
off and browse for pr0n and **me** ample time to prepare my presentation
and fix bugs (read slack off and browser for pr0n). And on the flip side
NWC presumably provided (in the conference rooms) free WiFi but no one I
met managed to actually connect to any of the access points. What was
even worth was the fact they provided no internet at all in the rooms
which was an extra $10 per 24h (well, technically it was $9.95 but who
counts).

**Winner this round: OSMC**

Again kind of hard to loose against paying $20 for Internet access in my
room and not having a working WiFi in the conference area.

Loot\ |DSC02810|
================

I have been several years to OSMC and Netways tend to provide very
little in the way of loot. What you get is essentially a “certificate“
(read letter saying Michael was there) and for speaking and some adverts
and what not. In addition to this you pretty much get nothing else for
speaking. I guess you could call the “lunchbox” loot but that’s mainly a
sandwich and some Juice and a fruit so not really my thing I guess.
Where as Nagios went all the way here giving out candy, a book and one
of them fancy mugs.

**Winner this round: NWC**

Mainly for actually providing loot…

Conclusion
==========

**So I guess the conclusion is a tie right?**

And rightly so, both conference were really good and well worth a visit.
For me as a speaker and long time visitor of OSMC it was pretty nice to
get to see somewhere else for a change but both conference have
excellent speaker and nice presentations (hay, I spoke at both of them

Final words!
============

Again, so, so so sorry Ethan, Mary, Bernd and Pamela for

very nice work and I enjoyed myself immensely! So to me you are all
winners for putting in all this effort…

**A big thank you to everyone involved in arranging these conferences!**
