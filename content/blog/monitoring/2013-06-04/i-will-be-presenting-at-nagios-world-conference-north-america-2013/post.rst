Just thought I'd drop a short note mentioning my
presentation for NWCNA 2013 has been accepted and I will be presenting
there.

The talk is (surprise surprise) about the new features of NSClient++
with a heavy focus on the up-coming 0.4.2 version which will take
real-time monitoring to a whole new level.

.. PELICAN_END_SUMMARY

Hopefully 0.4.2 will be out (at least in beta) by then.

The abstract is:
================

| ***NSClient++ - Whats New***
|  *Knowledge Level: Medium*
|  Michael will introduce new and upcoming features of NSClient++ such
  as real-time log file analytic as well as real-time system monitoring.

  as well as protocol enhancements and distributed setups.
