Michael Medin is a senior architect and open source developer and has (among other things) written the de-facto agent for monitoring (among other things) windows based servers from (among other things) Nagios: NSClient++.
He has a long background in integration and Service Oriented Development as well as Security and CI/CD.

In his not-so-spare time he works as an architect building everything from IDP to Edge/IoT software. When he is not working diligently at his computer he is often found riding his mountain bike along some rocky single track in the glorious Swedish countryside or attempting to learn to Ski during the winter season.
