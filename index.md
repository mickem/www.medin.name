# Who is Michael Medin?

As a developer I develop various open source software in my spare time and various proprietary software in my not-so-spare time.
Currently I am working for [Pricer](https://pricer.com) where I until recently was the architect of their "new platform" in charge of new Services and the IDP (Internal Development Platform), and more recently I am in charge of developing the new Label system where I focus a lot of building IoT and Edge software in Rust, Java and Typescript.

## Some open source projects I have written

* [NSClient++](https://nsclient.org) The defacto standard monitoring agent for Nagios on Windows.
* [Dakboard](https://github.com/mickem/medin.name.dakboard), A [DakBoard](https://dakboard.com) client for [Homey](https://homey.com). Which I use to show dashboards around the house.
* [Temperature Manager](https://github.com/mickem/medin.name.temperature), A Temperature manager for [Homey](https://homey.com) which I use to orchestrate my heating system.

This page is under construction so I will add some more content here soon(TM) and might add back some of the old blog posts but not 100% sure...
